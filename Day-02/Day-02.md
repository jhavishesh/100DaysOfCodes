Today I have solved 3 problems of DSA-Busted of 450 Questions.

Problem 1: Find the maximum and minimum element in an array

Problem 2:  Kth Smallest Element 

Problem 3:  (Sort 0s,1s,2s)

I learned about the DNF Algorithm and Max and Min Heap and how to define and implement heap using priority queue.

Also I learned about the widely used STL function like sort,reverse,size,length.
