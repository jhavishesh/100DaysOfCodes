/*  Step-by-step Binary Search Algorithm: We basically ignore half of the elements just after one comparison.

Compare x with the middle element.
If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for the right half.
Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half.  */


//Solution:

int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x)
{
    while (l <= r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;  //to avoid overflow
 
        // Check if x is present at mid
        if (arr[m] == x)
            return m;
 
        // If x greater, ignore left half
        if (arr[m] < x)
            l = m + 1;
 
        // If x is smaller, ignore right half
        else
            r = m - 1;
    }
 
    // if we reach here, then element was
    // not present
    return -1;
}
